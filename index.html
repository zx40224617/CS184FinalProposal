      <h2>Overview</h2>
      This project aims to create an immersive virtual environment using VR
      where users can interact with objects through natural hand gestures. By
      leveraging VR technology and Unity's robust development platform, the
      project focuses on real-time mesh deformation when a user’s hand contacts
      virtual objects. The goal is to simulate realistic physical responses and
      enhance the tactile feedback within the VR space

      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      As VR gradually become a big part of computer graphics, and has been
      implemented in medical, entertainment, education, and much more fileds. We
      want to understand how the physical hand-object interaction in VR world
      can be achieved. We are aware of the fact that there are already some
      existing tool for this, but we are aim to understand the pipeline and
      reimplement the idea. The chanllenge will now come to how to simulate
      different object deformation given different hand gesture, force, and
      object properties. We aim to look for some existing algorithm for mesh
      deformation that we can try to implement and see how that can simulate
      different senarios, and evaluate by how fast and realistic it is.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Develop a VR application in Unity that utilizes Meta’s SDK in Unity to
          achieve real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement collision detection between user hands and virtual objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Design a mesh deformation system that alters the object’s geometry
          based on different properties (e.g., material stiffness, elasticity).
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide a visually compelling and interactive experience that mimics
          realistic hand-object interactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are trying to see how well the mesh deformation can represent the
          physcial interaction without considering volumetric rendering.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we measure the quality and performance:</h2>
      Since we hope to deliver a real time interactive system, we will meausre
      the performance using the computing time and fidelity of the simulation of
      the object deformation based on the interaction. (e.g. how real it looks
      compare to real objects and hand interaction)

      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What we plan to deliver:
          <ul>
            <li>
              A functional VR application demonstrating real-time hand-object
              interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              A dynamic mesh deformation system that adjusts object shapes based
              on interaction properties.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          What we hope to deliver:
          <ul>
            <li>
              A realistic haptic feedback based on the propeties of the object
            </li>
            <li>
              A custom shader that is realisic and real time for the deformation
              of the objects
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Schedule</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make ourselves familiar with Unity, the headset and existing tools (~
          1 week)
        </li>
        <li>
          ooking and trying different nesh deformation algorithm (~ 1 week)
        </li>
        <li>
          Testing different object properties and gesture and modify current
          system if needed (~ 1.5 week)
        </li>
        <li>
          Check to see is there anything that we can add or imporve if there is
          more time left and also finalize the report (rest of the time)
        </li>
      </ol>
